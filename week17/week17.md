## DAT110: Distributed Systems and Network Technology

### Lab Week 17: 20/4 - 24/4

### Exercise 17.1: Link-layer

Chapter 6 in the networking book

- Review questions R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, and R15
- Problems P14, P15, P16, P21, and P22

### Exercise 17.2: Address resolution protocol

Use the `arp` command line tool to show the content of the ARP table / cache on your PC. Can you locate the MAC address of your default router / gateway?

Start Wireshark and the capturing of packets from your Ethernet interface.

Yse `arp` to delete the content of the ARP cache and try issue, e.g., a ping www.example.com command. Which ARP query and replies does the sending of the ping datagram trigger?
