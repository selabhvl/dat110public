## DAT110: Distributed Systems and Network Technology

### Lab Week 17: 21/4 - 25/4

### Exercise 1: Network Layer - Data Plane

From Chapter 4 in the networking book

##### Review questions

R9 (forwarding), R17 (encapsulation), R20 (fragmentation), R21 (network interfaces), R22 (IP addresses) , R24 (forwarding)

##### Problems

- P1 (forwarding tables), P2 (forwarding)
- P10 (longest prefix matching), P11 (subnets)
- P17 (fragmentation)
- P18 (network address translation)

### Exercise 2: Network Layer - Control Plane

From Chapter 5 in the networking book

- Review question R5 (counting to infinity problem)
- Problem P3 (run Dikjstra's algorithm on an example network)
- Problem P5 (run Belmann-Ford Distance Vector Algorithm on an example)

### Exercise 3: Link-layer - Exam Exercise 2019

##### a)

Explain what information is stored in an ARP table

##### b)

Consider a local area network consisting of three hosts with IP and MAC addresses as specified in the figure below and a switch with interfaces numbered 1-3 as specified in the figure. Assume that the ARP tables on all hosts are empty and that the switch-table on the switch is empty.

![](assets/markdown-img-paste-20200409164038903.png)

What is the content of the ARP table on the host with IP address 112.223.334.1 after an IP datagram from 112.223.334.1 to 112.223.334.3 has been sent? **Justify your answer**

##### c)

What will the content of the switch-table be after an IP datagram from 112.223.334.1 to 112.223.334.3 has been sent? **Justify your answer**
