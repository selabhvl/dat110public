## DAT110: Distributed Systems and Network Technology

### Lab Week 16: 19/4 - 22/4

### Exercise 1: Link-layer

Chapter 6 in the networking book

- Review questions R9, R10, R11, R12, R13, and R15
- Problems P14, P15, P16, P21, and P22

### Exercise 2: Address resolution protocol

Use the `arp` command line tool to show the content of the ARP table / cache on your PC. Can you locate the MAC address of your default router / gateway?

Start Wireshark and the capturing of packets from your Ethernet interface.

Use `arp` to delete the content of the ARP cache and to try issue, e.g., a `ping www.example.com` command.

Which ARP query and replies does the sending of the ping datagram trigger?
