/**
 * For demonstration purpose in dat110 course.
 * This is a simple client that uses the registry as a middleware where a client stub is generated using the
 * exposed interface provided by the server.
 * The client's stub is used to marshall the parameters (int a, int b, addNumbers), send them as a message to the server's stub, 
 * and unmarshall the result from the server which is now stored in the sum variable and written to the console.
 * Note that, the registry must know the correct port on which the rpcserver is running. In this case, port 9000
