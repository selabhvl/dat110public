### Project 4 - Part C: Project report

You are required to write a 6-page (excluding cover page) project report documenting your design, implementation, and test of the IoT-cloud access control system.

The report can be written in Norwegian or English, but MUST use 11pt font for the main text.

The text should be organised into the following parts. For each section, an approximate estimate of the number of pages has been provided.

- **Cover page:** containing project title and the names and student numbers of the group members

- **Introduction** (~1/4 page) given an overall description of the system that has been developed. The introduction should also give a reference to where your TinkerCAD design (Part A) and the REST device client and service implementation (Part B) can be found.

- **Access Control Design Model** (~1 page) presenting your finite state machine for the access control device that you developed in Part A. This section should contain a figure showing the finite state machine, and contain a short description of it, and the main design choices you have made.

- **Access Control Hardware/Software Implementation** (~1.5 pages) explaining how you have implemented the hardware and the software of the access control device. The section should contain a figure presenting your TinkerCAD circuit design

- **REST API cloud service** (~1.5 page) explaining how you have implemented the cloud service using the Spark/Java framework. It should briefly explain how you have setup the routes in the service, how you have implemented the storage of access codes and the access log, and how you have used Gson to obtain JSON representations of the information exchanged.

- **Device Communication** (~1 page) explaining how you have implemented the network communication in the access control device, i.e., the HTTP GET and POST operations on the virtual IoT device.

- **System Testing** (~ 1/2 page) explaining how you have tested the operation of the completed IoT-cloud system.

- **Conclusions** (~1/4 page) briefly summing of the status of the project, including things that was not completed or which the group did not manage to get to work properly.

The report can be written using any text processing system, but the report must be delivered via Canvas as a PDF file.

You are free to change the heading above, but you need to make sure that your report covers all parts listed above and that the balance between the individual parts are maintained.

### LaTeX Text Processing System - Optional

Those interested in learning about the LaTeX text processing system for scientific writing may have a look at the template and resources available via:

https://github.com/selabhvl/dat250-projectreport-template.git

Please not the LaTeX above is a template used for a different course and hence you will have to modify the headings to match the organisation of the project report outlined above.
